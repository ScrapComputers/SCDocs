            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We're back! After a bit of a break, we’re dropping a <strong>Pre-V3</strong> update for ScrapComputers. It’s been a while since our
last release, so we wanted to roll out some completed features and improvements ahead of the full V3 update.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-a-pre-v3-update">Why a Pre-V3 Update?<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/pre-v3-update#why-a-pre-v3-update" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why a Pre-V3 Update?" title="Direct link to Why a Pre-V3 Update?">​</a></h2>
<p>It’s been quiet on the update front, infact too quiet. While we’ve been working on other projects, we've also accumulated some
solid improvements and new features in the ScrapComputers repo. Rather than let them gather dust, we decided to ship
pre-update. We’re not one of those dev teams that disappears after one good release.</p>
<p>We’re still here, and we’re still building.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-been-going-on">What’s Been Going On?<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/pre-v3-update#whats-been-going-on" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s Been Going On?" title="Direct link to What’s Been Going On?">​</a></h2>
<p>Not a ton, if we’re being honest. Most of the real development happened in March and July, with a bit of downtime in between.</p>
<p>The good news? We’ve re-focused on ScrapComputers again, and the full <strong>V3 update</strong> is expected in the next 1–2 months
but no promises though!</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-included-in-this-update">What’s Included in This Update?<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/pre-v3-update#whats-included-in-this-update" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s Included in This Update?" title="Direct link to What’s Included in This Update?">​</a></h2>

<p>The old ban system didn’t serve much purpose anymore, so we scrapped it.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="computer-optimizations--bug-fixes">Computer Optimizations &amp; Bug Fixes<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/pre-v3-update#computer-optimizations--bug-fixes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Computer Optimizations &amp; Bug Fixes" title="Direct link to Computer Optimizations &amp; Bug Fixes">​</a></h3>
<p>Various under-the-hood improvements and bug fixes should make the computer experience smoother and more stable.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="config-system-upgrades">Config System Upgrades<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/pre-v3-update#config-system-upgrades" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Config System Upgrades" title="Direct link to Config System Upgrades">​</a></h3>
<p>The configuration system is now more compatible with older world saves meaning that your worlds with ScrapComputers 1.0 should
be still playable without error!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="more-hdd-storage">More HDD Storage<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/pre-v3-update#more-hdd-storage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to More HDD Storage" title="Direct link to More HDD Storage">​</a></h3>
<p>We’ve optimized the HDD which should let you store data in it, even though we don't expect you to have a HDD with 1 megabyte of data in it.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-kwc-compression-library">New: KWC Compression Library<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/pre-v3-update#new-kwc-compression-library" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New: KWC Compression Library" title="Direct link to New: KWC Compression Library">​</a></h3>
<p>Introducing <strong>KWC</strong> (Keyword Compression)</p>
<p>It's a custom string compression system that splits strings into two arrays: one for keywords and one for indexes. It’s lightweight
and efficient.</p>

<p>Ben Bingo has fixed an issue with how the camera handles color caching. Say goodbye to weird visual bugs!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="display-optimizations--new-function">Display Optimizations &amp; New Function<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/pre-v3-update#display-optimizations--new-function" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Display Optimizations &amp; New Function" title="Direct link to Display Optimizations &amp; New Function">​</a></h3>
<p>Touchscreen displays now run faster and smoother. We’ve also added a new <code>drawWithPoints()</code> function, which lets you draw filled
polygons using just points, powered by an earcut algorithm.</p>

<p>Fixed a few bugs with ASCFManager. While we considered a V2, the truth is it's already fast enough, turns out <code>drawFilledTriangle</code>
was the real slowdown.</p>

<p>So... about ScGui. I (VeraDev) may have over-promised here. Building a full GUI library is <em>way</em> harder than expected.
While I don’t want to scrap the project, it might get shelved if progress stalls too much.</p>

<p>There’s still tons of untapped potential in ScrapComputers. We’re committed to keeping the mod alive and improving it, even
if our release schedule has been a bit slow and communication sparse.</p>
<p>As long as motivation and discipline stay strong, ScrapComputers will keep evolving.</p>

<p>On translations for the website and mod... yeah. Not much has happened despite recruiting:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 Russian translators</li>
<li>1 Romanian/Norwegian translator</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, we’re considering removing translation support entirely and making ScrapComputers English-only.</p>

<p>We've added a new function called <code>math.pid</code>. It's an implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional%E2%80%93integral%E2%80%93derivative_controller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller</strong></a> or PID for short. You can set a value and configure parameters for P, I, and D, and it will error-correct and provide you with the adjusted value.</p>

<p>The <code>onReload()</code> callback has been added to the mod. It is called whenever the computer's code is saved/updated.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="display-optimizations">Display Optimizations<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/the-utility-update#display-optimizations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Display Optimizations" title="Direct link to Display Optimizations">​</a></h3>
<p>Display optimizations have been improved and are now significantly faster than before!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="radar-is-now-upgraded">Radar is now upgraded<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/the-utility-update#radar-is-now-upgraded" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Radar is now upgraded" title="Direct link to Radar is now upgraded">​</a></h3>
<p>We've upgraded the radars! They can now detect both units and characters. The range has also been increased.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="you-like-gravity-right">You like gravity, right?<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/the-utility-update#you-like-gravity-right" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to You like gravity, right?" title="Direct link to You like gravity, right?">​</a></h3>
<p>Gravity Controllers are now in the mod. They let you manipulate the creation's gravity or even disable gravity.</p>

<p>There are now two audio players you can use with the speakers. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NBS</strong>: Note Block Song, a Minecraft sound format from a mod.</li>
<li><strong>MIDI</strong>: A standard electronic music format.</li>
</ul>
<p>The MIDI player was created by ForgivenID, props to him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P.S. You cannot just insert a MIDI file directly into the game, so check the mod’s repository or its files on your computer for a folder (./Python) containing a converter that transforms MIDI into computer-readable text.

<p>We've focused on improving video playback at higher resolutions and in color. This means you can now play <em>Bad Apple</em> at 128x128 with color, and it will only take up <strong>40 MB</strong>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="upgraded-bitstream--base64">Upgraded Bitstream &amp; Base64<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/the-utility-update#upgraded-bitstream--base64" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Upgraded Bitstream &amp; Base64" title="Direct link to Upgraded Bitstream &amp; Base64">​</a></h3>
<p>The base64 library has been upgraded for greater accuracy.<br>

<p>Although we're pushing updates at a slower pace (because we have lives), VeraDev is still releasing small updates for bug fixes and user-requested features. We're continuously working on it and adding new features.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-about-scgui">What about ScGui?<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/the-utility-update#what-about-scgui" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What about ScGui?" title="Direct link to What about ScGui?">​</a></h3>
<p>For those who don't know, VeraDev is working on a very MASSIVE GUI framework for ScrapComputers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this will take a lot of time to complete, mainly because structuring the code and developing the core internals is a huge task. As of writing this blog post, the current revision is 4, as VeraDev is still trying to create a stable codebase for such a large-scale project.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-font-manager">New font manager<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/mod-expansion-and-optimization#new-font-manager" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New font manager" title="Direct link to New font manager">​</a></h3>
<p>The new font manager allows for a wide range of use cases including our new TTF font rendering system, this allows for any TTF font to be imported into ScrapComputers. The new font manager also hosts the ability to do live text scaling, rotation and coloring. Along side this we have a much larger lists of fonts to choose from!</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="TTF Font Renderer" src="https://scrapcomputers.dev/assets/images/ttf-helloworld-example-553e0d7150ef7a6a151e820cf6777dc3.png" title="Custom TTF font with dynamic scale and rotation" width="1427" height="1001" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>A simple component which allows you to control the color of a block sized LED light, useful for those moments where you need some sick computer controller mood lighting.</p>

<p>More python tools, such as: TTF font conversion, an obj model converter and more!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-new-models">The New Models<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/mod-expansion-and-optimization#the-new-models" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The New Models" title="Direct link to The New Models">​</a></h3>
<p>VeraDev has been slowly dying in blender once again, he has returned with a new GPS and Laser model, they look very nice!</p>
<p>Here they are</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="New GPS Model Image" src="https://scrapcomputers.dev/assets/images/gps-model-example-28f004e626c0096499ee1caa3354e4e3.png" title="New GPS model" width="1428" height="495" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>Because of these new modules added, we have made our environment a bit bigger to accomodate everything, we have also decided to unlock sm.json.open from the unsafe environment for more choices when it comes to relying on files stored in blueprints.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-examples">New Examples<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/mod-expansion-and-optimization#new-examples" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New Examples" title="Direct link to New Examples">​</a></h3>
<p>The PONG! and the whiteboard example have been added so you can see how some of the new modules are implemented.</p>
<p>Here is pong in action (with debug mode enabled):</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not a huge update, but still an exciting one! We've fixed a pesky speaker bug, introduced more display optimizations, and perhaps best of all, drastically improved the quality and speed of image rendering.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="better-image-support">Better Image Support<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/speaker-fix-and-images-added#better-image-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Better Image Support" title="Direct link to Better Image Support">​</a></h2>
<p>Images are looking much sharper and loading faster than ever. You can now render a <strong>1080p</strong> image in just a couple of seconds! This means better performance and more visually stunning outputs in record time. Whether you're working with high-res assets or generating beautiful graphics, the improved rendering speed will make your workflow smoother.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="display-optimization">Display Optimization<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/speaker-fix-and-images-added#display-optimization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Display Optimization" title="Direct link to Display Optimization">​</a></h2>
<p>Our resident display wizard, Ben Bingo, has gone all out once again. The guy doesn’t know when to quit! With his latest round of optimizations, display performance has been fine-tuned even further, making everything smoother, crisper, and faster.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="speaker-bugfix">Speaker Bugfix<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/speaker-fix-and-images-added#speaker-bugfix" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Speaker Bugfix" title="Direct link to Speaker Bugfix">​</a></h2>
<p>There was a speaker bug which didnt allow you to use the range of the pitch modifier in playNote as the speaker was asserting this value to be an integer and not a number, this has now been fixed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This update isn't huge, but it improves how you use the mod and fixes some bugs along the way. We’ve also made several optimizations to make things run smoother.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="general-optimizations">General Optimizations<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/qol-improvement-update#general-optimizations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to General Optimizations" title="Direct link to General Optimizations">​</a></h2>
<p>We’ve worked on making the mod faster and more efficient. One big change is that we’ve now optimized the <strong>LuaVM</strong> for the first time. These changes may not be obvious right away, but you should notice things running more smoothly, especially when doing more complex tasks.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="luavm-optimizations">LuaVM Optimizations<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/qol-improvement-update#luavm-optimizations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to LuaVM Optimizations" title="Direct link to LuaVM Optimizations">​</a></h2>
<p>While adding image support, we were using <strong>one long string</strong> to handle image data. This caused a lot of slowdown, especially with larger images (like 256x256). The problem was with the LuaVM’s interpreter, <strong>Yueliang</strong>, which wasn’t good at handling long strings.</p>
<p>After VeraDev optimized it, the difference was huge. Check out the performance graph below:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="LuaX String Reading Optimization Graph" src="https://scrapcomputers.dev/assets/images/luax-string-reading-optimization-graph-20d67cd73b1b83ff294ff00b758c6c28.png" title="Graph of the LuaVM reading string&amp;#39;s in performance." width="3531" height="1482" class="img_ev3q"><br>
<em>Each dot shows a test of reading a 100 KiB string.</em></p>
<p>As you can see, this is a <strong>massive improvement</strong>. Now, large data can be stored and processed without slowing down the computer. (At least until Scrap Mechanic corrupts it!)</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="semi-live-syntax-highlighting">Semi-Live Syntax Highlighting<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/qol-improvement-update#semi-live-syntax-highlighting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Semi-Live Syntax Highlighting" title="Direct link to Semi-Live Syntax Highlighting">​</a></h2>
<p>We’ve added <strong>Semi-Live Syntax Highlighting</strong> for the in-game computer. This makes your code much easier to read and understand.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Syntax Highlighting Image" src="https://scrapcomputers.dev/assets/images/syntax-highlighting-showcase-cdf0c1736b3c0f5b105eccd6f9fbcf39.png" title="Syntax Highlighting in action" width="2343" height="1269" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>It automatically highlights code as you type, but due to game limitations, it only works when typing at the end of the entire code. You can press a button to manually refresh the highlighting when needed.</p>
<p>Syntax highlighting also helps you find errors faster. Look at this example:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Syntax Highlighting Error Image" src="https://scrapcomputers.dev/assets/images/syntax-highlighting-showcase-error-d248f887ba0762917913d6cac2215ded.png" title="Error detection with syntax highlighting" width="770" height="621" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The line with the error turns <strong>red</strong>, and related functions show up as <strong>dark red</strong>. This makes finding and fixing mistakes much easier!</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="translation-support">Translation Support<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/qol-improvement-update#translation-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Translation Support" title="Direct link to Translation Support">​</a></h2>
<p>We’ve added a <strong>LanguageManager</strong> so you can now add translations to the mod. You can include any language, even those not supported by Scrap Mechanic. However, some fonts might not work if the game doesn’t support them, especially for non-Latin languages.</p>
<p>Note: This doesn’t work for inventory descriptions. because those are stored in json, where we cant modify them via Lua.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="addons-can-now-add-examples">Addons Can Now Add Examples<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/qol-improvement-update#addons-can-now-add-examples" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Addons Can Now Add Examples" title="Direct link to Addons Can Now Add Examples">​</a></h2>
<p><em>(For addon developers)</em></p>
<p>We’ve added an <strong>ExampleManager</strong>, which allows addon developers to include code examples for the computer. This is a simple feature to make it easier for users to learn how to use your addons.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-fonts">New Fonts<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/qol-improvement-update#new-fonts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New Fonts" title="Direct link to New Fonts">​</a></h2>
<p>We’ve added new fonts in this update. Although 4 old fonts were removed, we’ve added 5 new ones. 4 of these come from <em>Minecraft</em>, and the last one is a custom font created by <strong>VeraDev</strong>, designed for smaller screens.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="display-optimization">Display Optimization<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/qol-improvement-update#display-optimization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Display Optimization" title="Direct link to Display Optimization">​</a></h2>
<p>Ben Bingo has optimized the display even more. He’s always looking for ways to make things faster, and VeraDev (the writer of this blog) is trying to tell him to stop optimizing as he is going too far.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="image-generator">Image Generator<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/qol-improvement-update#image-generator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Image Generator" title="Direct link to Image Generator">​</a></h2>
<p>You can now convert PNG images to a special format that works with our <strong>Image Renderer Example</strong>. Once converted, you can display these images directly on the computer screen, giving you new ways to add visuals in the game.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thats-it">Thats it!<a href="https://scrapcomputers.dev/blog/qol-improvement-update#thats-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Thats it!" title="Direct link to Thats it!">​</a></h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the biggest update we have put together so far, lots of changes, bug fixes and optimizations have happened. We reccomend you see the rest of the documentation to see everything that has changed, I will only name a few of the major things.</p>
<p>For some general points, we have remastered nearly all component models and added some extra designs, we have also fixed a general bug with the data list and components sometimes not existing when they do.</p>
<h1>RC Bug:</h1>
<ul>
<li>A working fix has been reimplemented</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We just unimplemented a bugfix as our bugfix. That is not even a joke.</p>
<p>You might be wondering, "Did we just undo a bugfix to solve a problem?" Yes, that’s precisely what happened! In our latest update for ScrapComputers, we had to remove a previous bugfix and essentially reintroduce a bug to address an even more significant issue. Let's dive into the details.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the RC bug in ScrapComputers, it allows remote control of components even when they have no physical connections. Sounds neat, right? Well, not really. While this might seem like a handy feature, it led to unexpected behavior and caused more harm than good. The original fix aimed to tackle this issue but ended up causing more trouble. So, we had to roll back the fix to restore stability.</p>
<p>An example of the issues caused by the RC bug was that it could "brick" your computer. Users reported receiving an error message saying, "The component cannot be found," even though the component was still connected. This essentially rendered the computer useless because you could no longer interact with that component, which is a significant problem!</p>
<h1>What Else Is New?</h1>
<p>Besides the rollback of the RC bugfix, we've implemented a few other updates and changes to improve your experience with ScrapComputers. Here's the full changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed RC Bugfix: We had to revert the fix for the RC bug due to its negative impact.</li>
<li>Enhanced Keyboard Functionality in Seats: You can now use the keyboard while sitting in a seat, even though there's no icon indicating this feature when you're connected to the seat.</li>
<li>Fixed Critical Computer Issue: Previously, the computer wasn’t affected by our ban-system process. This has now been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What Does This Mean for You?</h1>
<p>While it might sound counterintuitive to reintroduce a bug, this step was necessary to maintain stability and usability. We’re committed to providing you with a seamless experience in ScrapComputers, and sometimes that involves a bit of backtracking to move forward.</p>
<h1>Fresh New Bug Discovery!</h1>
<p>During our testing and community feedback, we discovered a new bug. One of our community members, The Red Builder, encountered an issue while working on a project with ScrapComputers. When setting <code>self.cl</code> to an empty table in an unsafe environment, it caused significant problems. ScrapComputers uses self.cl for client-side variables, so when he did that, it effectively wiped out his entire computer setup, resulting in errors like <code>unable to find self.sv</code>, which is not typical behavior.</p>
<p>We are planning to fix this issue soon. In the meantime, we recommend avoiding setting <code>self.sv</code> or <code>self.cl</code> in the computer when in an unsafe environment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We just made our add-on system a LOT better than before! After 1 issue we encountered, we have done it!</p>
<p>But first, let's dive around a couple of days ago. So, we had an issue where we couldn't manage to sync a variable across mods, but when <strong>Ben Bingo</strong> asked that issue in <strong>The Guild of Scrap Mechanic Modders</strong>. Then <strong>June</strong> gave us the solution! One came after the other. Now we have the best Addon System out of all other computer mods.</p>
<p>We also are the 1st ever computer mod to allow the Addon Developers to make configurations with just code! You can make configurations in just two lines, 1 for initializing the config functions and the other for creating them!</p>
<p>After changing how the structure works in the mod and how things work, You can also modify the environment variables of the Computer API! You can also access the Computer API from Components via the Addon API!</p>
<p>You can also now take a masked frame for cameras via the <code>getMaskedFrame</code> function. It would be useful for such as detecting objects. What it does is via a mask parameter, Pixels become white if that raycast's result type is the mask (So if the mask is "body", all white pixels mean that it hit a "body"). It can also be an array in case you want to detect multiple things.</p>
<p>We also added 2 new modules. <strong>The BitStream Module and the VPBS Module.</strong> The BitStream Module is a Module to read/write to binary via bitstreams! The VPBS module makes converting from <strong>lua tables to binary and vice-versa easier</strong> via the <strong>bitstream module.</strong></p>
<p>There are also more table functions added to your table's tables!</p>
<p>We also <strong>improved the config updater</strong> to be done for every config option. So you don't have to reset your configuration when making addons</p>
<p>We also fixed some bugs in the mod! One of the bugs has been solved, but not in the other computer mods.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who supported our mods, the people who gaved us suggestions and found bugs! We see you in the next update!</p>]]></content:encoded>
