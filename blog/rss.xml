            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not a huge update, but still an exciting one! We've fixed a pesky speaker bug, introduced more display optimizations, and perhaps best of all, drastically improved the quality and speed of image rendering.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="better-image-support">Better Image Support<a href="https://scrapcomputers.github.io/SCDocs/blog/speaker-fix-and-images-added#better-image-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Better Image Support" title="Direct link to Better Image Support">​</a></h2>
<p>Images are looking much sharper and loading faster than ever. You can now render a <strong>1080p</strong> image in just a couple of seconds! This means better performance and more visually stunning outputs in record time. Whether you're working with high-res assets or generating beautiful graphics, the improved rendering speed will make your workflow smoother.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="display-optimization">Display Optimization<a href="https://scrapcomputers.github.io/SCDocs/blog/speaker-fix-and-images-added#display-optimization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Display Optimization" title="Direct link to Display Optimization">​</a></h2>
<p>Our resident display wizard, Ben Bingo, has gone all out once again. The guy doesn’t know when to quit! With his latest round of optimizations, display performance has been fine-tuned even further, making everything smoother, crisper, and faster.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="speaker-bugfix">Speaker Bugfix<a href="https://scrapcomputers.github.io/SCDocs/blog/speaker-fix-and-images-added#speaker-bugfix" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Speaker Bugfix" title="Direct link to Speaker Bugfix">​</a></h2>
<p>There was a speaker bug which didnt allow you to use the range of the pitch modifier in playNote as the speaker was asserting this value to be an integer and not a number, this has now been fixed.</p>

<p>That's all for this update! We’re always working on more behind-the-scenes improvements, so stay tuned for what's next!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This update isn't huge, but it improves how you use the mod and fixes some bugs along the way. We’ve also made several optimizations to make things run smoother.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="general-optimizations">General Optimizations<a href="https://scrapcomputers.github.io/SCDocs/blog/qol-improvement-update#general-optimizations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to General Optimizations" title="Direct link to General Optimizations">​</a></h2>
<p>We’ve worked on making the mod faster and more efficient. One big change is that we’ve now optimized the <strong>LuaVM</strong> for the first time. These changes may not be obvious right away, but you should notice things running more smoothly, especially when doing more complex tasks.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="luavm-optimizations">LuaVM Optimizations<a href="https://scrapcomputers.github.io/SCDocs/blog/qol-improvement-update#luavm-optimizations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to LuaVM Optimizations" title="Direct link to LuaVM Optimizations">​</a></h2>
<p>While adding image support, we were using <strong>one long string</strong> to handle image data. This caused a lot of slowdown, especially with larger images (like 256x256). The problem was with the LuaVM’s interpreter, <strong>Yueliang</strong>, which wasn’t good at handling long strings.</p>
<p>After VeraDev optimized it, the difference was huge. Check out the performance graph below:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="LuaX String Reading Optimization Graph" src="https://scrapcomputers.github.io/SCDocs/assets/images/luax-string-reading-optimization-graph-20d67cd73b1b83ff294ff00b758c6c28.png" title="Graph of the LuaVM reading string&amp;#39;s in performance." width="3531" height="1482" class="img_ev3q"><br>
<em>Each dot shows a test of reading a 100 KiB string.</em></p>
<p>As you can see, this is a <strong>massive improvement</strong>. Now, large data can be stored and processed without slowing down the computer. (At least until Scrap Mechanic corrupts it!)</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="semi-live-syntax-highlighting">Semi-Live Syntax Highlighting<a href="https://scrapcomputers.github.io/SCDocs/blog/qol-improvement-update#semi-live-syntax-highlighting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Semi-Live Syntax Highlighting" title="Direct link to Semi-Live Syntax Highlighting">​</a></h2>
<p>We’ve added <strong>Semi-Live Syntax Highlighting</strong> for the in-game computer. This makes your code much easier to read and understand.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Syntax Highlighting Image" src="https://scrapcomputers.github.io/SCDocs/assets/images/syntax-highlighting-showcase-cdf0c1736b3c0f5b105eccd6f9fbcf39.png" title="Syntax Highlighting in action" width="2343" height="1269" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>It automatically highlights code as you type, but due to game limitations, it only works when typing at the end of the entire code. You can press a button to manually refresh the highlighting when needed.</p>
<p>Syntax highlighting also helps you find errors faster. Look at this example:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Syntax Highlighting Error Image" src="https://scrapcomputers.github.io/SCDocs/assets/images/syntax-highlighting-showcase-error-d248f887ba0762917913d6cac2215ded.png" title="Error detection with syntax highlighting" width="770" height="621" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The line with the error turns <strong>red</strong>, and related functions show up as <strong>dark red</strong>. This makes finding and fixing mistakes much easier!</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="translation-support">Translation Support<a href="https://scrapcomputers.github.io/SCDocs/blog/qol-improvement-update#translation-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Translation Support" title="Direct link to Translation Support">​</a></h2>
<p>We’ve added a <strong>LanguageManager</strong> so you can now add translations to the mod. You can include any language, even those not supported by Scrap Mechanic. However, some fonts might not work if the game doesn’t support them, especially for non-Latin languages.</p>
<p>Note: This doesn’t work for inventory descriptions. because those are stored in json, where we cant modify them via Lua.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="addons-can-now-add-examples">Addons Can Now Add Examples<a href="https://scrapcomputers.github.io/SCDocs/blog/qol-improvement-update#addons-can-now-add-examples" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Addons Can Now Add Examples" title="Direct link to Addons Can Now Add Examples">​</a></h2>
<p><em>(For addon developers)</em></p>
<p>We’ve added an <strong>ExampleManager</strong>, which allows addon developers to include code examples for the computer. This is a simple feature to make it easier for users to learn how to use your addons.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-fonts">New Fonts<a href="https://scrapcomputers.github.io/SCDocs/blog/qol-improvement-update#new-fonts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New Fonts" title="Direct link to New Fonts">​</a></h2>
<p>We’ve added new fonts in this update. Although 4 old fonts were removed, we’ve added 5 new ones. 4 of these come from <em>Minecraft</em>, and the last one is a custom font created by <strong>VeraDev</strong>, designed for smaller screens.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="display-optimization">Display Optimization<a href="https://scrapcomputers.github.io/SCDocs/blog/qol-improvement-update#display-optimization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Display Optimization" title="Direct link to Display Optimization">​</a></h2>
<p>Ben Bingo has optimized the display even more. He’s always looking for ways to make things faster, and VeraDev (the writer of this blog) is trying to tell him to stop optimizing as he is going too far.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="image-generator">Image Generator<a href="https://scrapcomputers.github.io/SCDocs/blog/qol-improvement-update#image-generator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Image Generator" title="Direct link to Image Generator">​</a></h2>
<p>You can now convert PNG images to a special format that works with our <strong>Image Renderer Example</strong>. Once converted, you can display these images directly on the computer screen, giving you new ways to add visuals in the game.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thats-it">Thats it!<a href="https://scrapcomputers.github.io/SCDocs/blog/qol-improvement-update#thats-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Thats it!" title="Direct link to Thats it!">​</a></h2>
<p>Thats the entire update, we will warn you tho, the next update will be a <strong>majour</strong> update so expect no updates for the following weeks!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the biggest update we have put together so far, lots of changes, bug fixes and optimizations have happened. We reccomend you see the rest of the documentation to see everything that has changed, I will only name a few of the major things.</p>
<p>For some general points, we have remastered nearly all component models and added some extra designs, we have also fixed a general bug with the data list and components sometimes not existing when they do.</p>
<h1>RC Bug:</h1>
<ul>
<li>A working fix has been reimplemented</li>
</ul>
<h1>Global functions:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Added a loadstring function which can also excecute bytecode in the unsafe env.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Display:</h1>
<ul>
<li>New backend system which includes bug fixes and a lot of optimisation.</li>
<li>Added getId, this returns the id of the display.</li>

<li>Culling speed increase.</li>
<li>Multiplayer fixes with display and touch screen syncing.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Camera:</h1>
<ul>
<li>New display drawing system which includes a lot of function renames, however now you can directly pass the display into the camera funciton, and it will draw it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We just unimplemented a bugfix as our bugfix. That is not even a joke.</p>
<p>You might be wondering, "Did we just undo a bugfix to solve a problem?" Yes, that’s precisely what happened! In our latest update for ScrapComputers, we had to remove a previous bugfix and essentially reintroduce a bug to address an even more significant issue. Let's dive into the details.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the RC bug in ScrapComputers, it allows remote control of components even when they have no physical connections. Sounds neat, right? Well, not really. While this might seem like a handy feature, it led to unexpected behavior and caused more harm than good. The original fix aimed to tackle this issue but ended up causing more trouble. So, we had to roll back the fix to restore stability.</p>
<p>An example of the issues caused by the RC bug was that it could "brick" your computer. Users reported receiving an error message saying, "The component cannot be found," even though the component was still connected. This essentially rendered the computer useless because you could no longer interact with that component, which is a significant problem!</p>
<h1>What Else Is New?</h1>
<p>Besides the rollback of the RC bugfix, we've implemented a few other updates and changes to improve your experience with ScrapComputers. Here's the full changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed RC Bugfix: We had to revert the fix for the RC bug due to its negative impact.</li>
<li>Enhanced Keyboard Functionality in Seats: You can now use the keyboard while sitting in a seat, even though there's no icon indicating this feature when you're connected to the seat.</li>
<li>Fixed Critical Computer Issue: Previously, the computer wasn’t affected by our ban-system process. This has now been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What Does This Mean for You?</h1>
<p>While it might sound counterintuitive to reintroduce a bug, this step was necessary to maintain stability and usability. We’re committed to providing you with a seamless experience in ScrapComputers, and sometimes that involves a bit of backtracking to move forward.</p>
<h1>Fresh New Bug Discovery!</h1>
<p>During our testing and community feedback, we discovered a new bug. One of our community members, The Red Builder, encountered an issue while working on a project with ScrapComputers. When setting <code>self.cl</code> to an empty table in an unsafe environment, it caused significant problems. ScrapComputers uses self.cl for client-side variables, so when he did that, it effectively wiped out his entire computer setup, resulting in errors like <code>unable to find self.sv</code>, which is not typical behavior.</p>
<p>We are planning to fix this issue soon. In the meantime, we recommend avoiding setting <code>self.sv</code> or <code>self.cl</code> in the computer when in an unsafe environment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We just made our add-on system a LOT better than before! After 1 issue we encountered, we have done it!</p>
<p>But first, let's dive around a couple of days ago. So, we had an issue where we couldn't manage to sync a variable across mods, but when <strong>Ben Bingo</strong> asked that issue in <strong>The Guild of Scrap Mechanic Modders</strong>. Then <strong>June</strong> gave us the solution! One came after the other. Now we have the best Addon System out of all other computer mods.</p>
<p>We also are the 1st ever computer mod to allow the Addon Developers to make configurations with just code! You can make configurations in just two lines, 1 for initializing the config functions and the other for creating them!</p>
<p>After changing how the structure works in the mod and how things work, You can also modify the environment variables of the Computer API! You can also access the Computer API from Components via the Addon API!</p>
<p>You can also now take a masked frame for cameras via the <code>getMaskedFrame</code> function. It would be useful for such as detecting objects. What it does is via a mask parameter, Pixels become white if that raycast's result type is the mask (So if the mask is "body", all white pixels mean that it hit a "body"). It can also be an array in case you want to detect multiple things.</p>
<p>We also added 2 new modules. <strong>The BitStream Module and the VPBS Module.</strong> The BitStream Module is a Module to read/write to binary via bitstreams! The VPBS module makes converting from <strong>lua tables to binary and vice-versa easier</strong> via the <strong>bitstream module.</strong></p>
<p>There are also more table functions added to your table's tables!</p>
<p>We also <strong>improved the config updater</strong> to be done for every config option. So you don't have to reset your configuration when making addons</p>
<p>We also fixed some bugs in the mod! One of the bugs has been solved, but not in the other computer mods.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who supported our mods, the people who gaved us suggestions and found bugs! We see you in the next update!</p>]]></content:encoded>
