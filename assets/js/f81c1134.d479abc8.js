After a bit of a break, we\u2019re dropping a **Pre-V3** update for ScrapComputers. It\u2019s been a while since our\\nlast release, so we wanted to roll out some completed features and improvements ahead of the full V3 update.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Why a Pre-V3 Update?\\nIt\u2019s been quiet on the update front, infact too quiet. While we\u2019ve been working on other projects, we\'ve also accumulated some\\nsolid improvements and new features in the ScrapComputers repo. Rather than let them gather dust, we decided to ship \\npre-update. We\u2019re not one of those dev teams that disappears after one good release.\\n\\nWe\u2019re still here, and we\u2019re still building.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What\u2019s Been Going On?\\nNot a ton, if we\u2019re being honest. Most of the real development happened in March and July, with a bit of downtime in between.\\n\\nThe good news? We\u2019ve re-focused on ScrapComputers again, and the full **V3 update** is expected in the next 1\u20132 months\\nbut no promises though!\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What\u2019s Included in This Update?\\n\\n### Ban System Removed\\nThe old ban system didn\u2019t serve much purpose anymore, so we scrapped it.\\n\\n### Computer Optimizations & Bug Fixes\\nVarious under-the-hood improvements and bug fixes should make the computer experience smoother and more stable.\\n\\n### Config System Upgrades\\nThe configuration system is now more compatible with older world saves meaning that your worlds with ScrapComputers 1.0 should\\nbe still playable without error!\\n\\n### More HDD Storage\\nWe\u2019ve optimized the HDD which should let you store data in it, even though we don\'t expect you to have a HDD with 1 megabyte of data in it.\\n\\n### New: KWC Compression Library\\nIntroducing **KWC** (Keyword Compression)\\n\\nIt\'s a custom string compression system that splits strings into two arrays: one for keywords and one for indexes. It\u2019s lightweight\\nand efficient.\\n\\n### Camera Color Cache Fix\\nBen Bingo has fixed an issue with how the camera handles color caching. Say goodbye to weird visual bugs!\\n\\n### Display Optimizations & New Function\\nTouchscreen displays now run faster and smoother. We\u2019ve also added a new `drawWithPoints()` function, which lets you draw filled\\npolygons using just points, powered by an earcut algorithm.\\n\\n:::note\\nThe points must be in either clockwise or counter-clockwise order. Hole support isn\'t included but maybe in the future!\\n:::\\n\\n### ASCFManager Fixes\\nFixed a few bugs with ASCFManager. While we considered a V2, the truth is it\'s already fast enough, turns out `drawFilledTriangle`\\nwas the real slowdown.\\n\\n:::info\\nWe also attempted **proper font rendering**, and while it technically worked, it looked bad and performed worse. That idea\u2019s\\nshelved... for now. (Maybe when we have a hole system for drawWithPoints and drawFilledTriangle was faster)\\n:::\\n\\n---\\n\\n## About ScGui\\n\\nSo... about ScGui. I (VeraDev) may have over-promised here. Building a full GUI library is *way* harder than expected.\\nWhile I don\u2019t want to scrap the project, it might get shelved if progress stalls too much.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Future of ScrapComputers\\n\\nThere\u2019s still tons of untapped potential in ScrapComputers. We\u2019re committed to keeping the mod alive and improving it, even\\nif our release schedule has been a bit slow and communication sparse.\\n\\nAs long as motivation and discipline stay strong, ScrapComputers will keep evolving.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Website & Mod Translations\\n\\nOn translations for the website and mod... yeah. Not much has happened despite recruiting:\\n- 3 Russian translators\\n- 1 Romanian/Norwegian translator\\n\\nAt this point, we\u2019re considering removing translation support entirely and making ScrapComputers English-only.\\n\\n:::danger Please don\u2019t harass translators\\nEven if progress has been slow, please **do not harass** translators. It\u2019s never okay, and people volunteer their time.\\n:::\\n\\n---\\n\\nThanks for sticking with us. Big things are coming. Stay tuned for the full **V3 update**!"},{"id":"the-utility-update","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-utility-update","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-04-the-utility-update.md","title":"The Utility Update","description":"We\'ve released an update adding a bunch of new features!

Notably, utilities to help you as well as several new additions!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Okay, so what\'s new?\\n\\n### math.pid\\n\\nWe\'ve added a new function called `math.pid`. It\'s an implementation of the [**Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional%E2%80%93integral%E2%80%93derivative_controller) or PID for short. You can set a value and configure parameters for P, I, and D, and it will error-correct and provide you with the adjusted value.\\n\\n### onReload() callback\\n\\nThe `onReload()` callback has been added to the mod. It is called whenever the computer\'s code is saved/updated.\\n\\n### Display Optimizations\\n\\nDisplay optimizations have been improved and are now significantly faster than before!\\n\\n### Radar is now upgraded\\n\\nWe\'ve upgraded the radars! They can now detect both units and characters. The range has also been increased.\\n\\n### You like gravity, right?\\n\\nGravity Controllers are now in the mod. They let you manipulate the creation\'s gravity or even disable gravity.\\n\\n### Speakers are improved\\n\\nWe\'ve improved the speakers, so they\'re much better and efficient than before.\\n\\n### NBS & MIDI Player\\n\\nThere are now two audio players you can use with the speakers. These are:\\n- **NBS**: Note Block Song, a Minecraft sound format from a mod.\\n- **MIDI**: A standard electronic music format.\\n\\nThe MIDI player was created by ForgivenID, props to him.\\n\\n>P.S. You cannot just insert a MIDI file directly into the game, so check the mod\u2019s repository or its files on your computer for a folder (./Python) containing a converter that transforms MIDI into computer-readable text. \\n -ForgivenID\\n\\n### LBI Optimizations\\n\\nWe\'ve optimized the LuaVM slightly. We believe we\'ve now reached the limits of optimizing our LuaVM!\\n\\n### Video Generation Upgrades\\n\\nWe\'ve focused on improving video playback at higher resolutions and in color. This means you can now play *Bad Apple* at 128x128 with color, and it will only take up **40 MB**.\\n\\n### Upgraded Bitstream & Base64\\n\\nThe base64 library has been upgraded for greater accuracy.  \\nThe bitstream library has been completely rewritten to be a **proper bitstream library**! Note that it\'s only Big-Endian.\\n\\n### LZ4 Compression Module\\n\\nIf you want to compress your binary data, you can now use LZ4 to compress it!\\n\\n---\\n\\n## So, what\'s next?\\n\\nAlthough we\'re pushing updates at a slower pace (because we have lives), VeraDev is still releasing small updates for bug fixes and user-requested features. We\'re continuously working on it and adding new features.\\n\\n### What about ScGui?\\n\\nFor those who don\'t know, VeraDev is working on a very MASSIVE GUI framework for ScrapComputers.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this will take a lot of time to complete, mainly because structuring the code and developing the core internals is a huge task. As of writing this blog post, the current revision is 4, as VeraDev is still trying to create a stable codebase for such a large-scale project."},{"id":"mod-expansion-and-optimization","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/mod-expansion-and-optimization","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-24-mod-expansion-and-optimization.md","title":"Further Mod Expansion, Fixes and Optimization Update","description":"A smaller precursor update to a larger once coming soon.

The new font manager also hosts the ability to do live text scaling, rotation and coloring. Along side this we have a much larger lists of fonts to choose from!\\n\\nHere is an example:\\n\\n![TTF Font Renderer](/img/blogs/ttf-helloworld-example.png \\"Custom TTF font with dynamic scale and rotation\\")\\n\\n### New LED light component\\n\\nA simple component which allows you to control the color of a block sized LED light, useful for those moments where you need some sick computer controller mood lighting.\\n\\n### More Python Tools\\n\\nMore python tools, such as: TTF font conversion, an obj model converter and more!\\n\\n### The New Models\\n\\nVeraDev has been slowly dying in blender once again, he has returned with a new GPS and Laser model, they look very nice!\\n\\nHere they are\\n\\n![New GPS Model Image](/img/blogs/gps-model-example.png \\"New GPS model\\")\\n\\n![New Laser Model Image](/img/blogs/laser-model-example.png \\"New laser model\\")\\n\\n### Bigger Environment\\n\\nBecause of these new modules added, we have made our environment a bit bigger to accomodate everything, we have also decided to unlock sm.json.open from the unsafe environment for more choices when it comes to relying on files stored in blueprints.\\n\\n### New Examples\\n\\nThe PONG! and the whiteboard example have been added so you can see how some of the new modules are implemented.\\n\\nHere is pong in action (with debug mode enabled):\\n\\n![PONG! Example Image](/img/blogs/pong-example.png \\"Pong doing some sick pong things\\")\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Fixes, Imporvements and Optimizations:\\n\\n### Display\\n\\nA lot more display optimization has taken place greatly improving the display over a lot more drawing scenarios especially large clear and redraw scenarios. There has also been some improvements to the touch screen system and culling system, find the new functions in the docs.\\n\\n### GPS\\n\\nAn extra point of data has been added to the GPS called degreeRotation which is a euler representation of the GPS\'s rotation.\\n\\n### Translation manager\\n\\nMissing and mispelled translations have been rectified, and improvements have been made to the Dutch translation.\\n\\n### Syntax manager\\n\\nMore optimisation and color correction has been done to the syntax manager, making the time it takes to format a lot of text very small while making it look as beautiful as VSCode!\\n\\n### LuaVM\\n\\nMore LuaVM optimisation has been done lowering the benchmark time scores by a few miliseconds.\\n\\n### Component Ratings\\n\\nComponents now have the non default ratings for a bit of realism.\\n\\n### Error Messages\\n\\nMore error management has been added incase something goes wrong with our end, also better error formatting.\\n\\n### Mod GUI\'s\\n\\nComponents with a GUI will now play audio when you open it.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThat\'s all for this update! We\u2019re always working on more behind-the-scenes improvements, so stay tuned for what\'s next!"},{"id":"speaker-fix-and-images-added","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/speaker-fix-and-images-added","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-06-speaker-fix-and-images.md","title":"Better Images & Speaker Bugfix Update","description":"Not a huge update, but still an exciting one!

We\u2019ve also made several optimizations to make things run smoother.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## General Optimizations\\n\\nWe\u2019ve worked on making the mod faster and more efficient. One big change is that we\u2019ve now optimized the **LuaVM** for the first time. These changes may not be obvious right away, but you should notice things running more smoothly, especially when doing more complex tasks.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## LuaVM Optimizations\\n\\nWhile adding image support, we were using **one long string** to handle image data. This caused a lot of slowdown, especially with larger images (like 256x256). The problem was with the LuaVM\u2019s interpreter, **Yueliang**, which wasn\u2019t good at handling long strings.\\n\\nAfter VeraDev optimized it, the difference was huge. Check out the performance graph below:\\n\\n![LuaX String Reading Optimization Graph](/img/blogs/luax-string-reading-optimization-graph.png \\"Graph of the LuaVM reading string\'s in performance.\\")  \\n*Each dot shows a test of reading a 100 KiB string.*\\n\\nAs you can see, this is a **massive improvement**. Now, large data can be stored and processed without slowing down the computer. (At least until Scrap Mechanic corrupts it!)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Semi-Live Syntax Highlighting\\n\\nWe\u2019ve added **Semi-Live Syntax Highlighting** for the in-game computer. This makes your code much easier to read and understand.\\n\\n![Syntax Highlighting Image](/img/blogs/syntax-highlighting-showcase.png \\"Syntax Highlighting in action\\")\\n\\nIt automatically highlights code as you type, but due to game limitations, it only works when typing at the end of the entire code. You can press a button to manually refresh the highlighting when needed.\\n\\nSyntax highlighting also helps you find errors faster. Look at this example:\\n\\n![Syntax Highlighting Error Image](/img/blogs/syntax-highlighting-showcase-error.png \\"Error detection with syntax highlighting\\")\\n\\nThe line with the error turns **red**, and related functions show up as **dark red**. This makes finding and fixing mistakes much easier!\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Translation Support\\n\\nWe\u2019ve added a **LanguageManager** so you can now add translations to the mod. You can include any language, even those not supported by Scrap Mechanic. However, some fonts might not work if the game doesn\u2019t support them, especially for non-Latin languages.\\n\\nNote: This doesn\u2019t work for inventory descriptions. because those are stored in json, where we cant modify them via Lua.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Addons Can Now Add Examples\\n\\n*(For addon developers)*\\n\\nWe\u2019ve added an **ExampleManager**, which allows addon developers to include code examples for the computer. This is a simple feature to make it easier for users to learn how to use your addons.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## New Fonts\\n\\nWe\u2019ve added new fonts in this update. Although 4 old fonts were removed, we\u2019ve added 5 new ones. 4 of these come from *Minecraft*, and the last one is a custom font created by **VeraDev**, designed for smaller screens.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Display Optimization\\n\\nBen Bingo has optimized the display even more. He\u2019s always looking for ways to make things faster, and VeraDev (the writer of this blog) is trying to tell him to stop optimizing as he is going too far.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Image Generator\\n\\nYou can now convert PNG images to a special format that works with our **Image Renderer Example**. Once converted, you can display these images directly on the computer screen, giving you new ways to add visuals in the game.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Thats it!\\n\\nThats the entire update, we will warn you tho, the next update will be a **majour** update so expect no updates for the following weeks! If you want to get teased on what the next update would contain, **[Check our discord!](https://discord.gg/6r46PkYr9s)** thats where you can get the latest teasers and talk to the team!"},{"id":"ScrapComputers-2.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/ScrapComputers-2.0","source":"@site/blog/2024-09-15-ScrapComputers-2.0.md","title":"The long awaited ScrapComputers V2.0 update","description":"This is the biggest update we have put together so far, lots of changes, bug fixes and optimizations have happened.

That is not even a joke.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nYou might be wondering, \\"Did we just undo a bugfix to solve a problem?\\" Yes, that\u2019s precisely what happened! In our latest update for ScrapComputers, we had to remove a previous bugfix and essentially reintroduce a bug to address an even more significant issue. Let\'s dive into the details.\\n\\n# The RC Bug: What\u2019s the Deal?\\n\\nFor those unfamiliar with the RC bug in ScrapComputers, it allows remote control of components even when they have no physical connections. Sounds neat, right? Well, not really. While this might seem like a handy feature, it led to unexpected behavior and caused more harm than good. The original fix aimed to tackle this issue but ended up causing more trouble. So, we had to roll back the fix to restore stability.\\n\\nAn example of the issues caused by the RC bug was that it could \\"brick\\" your computer. Users reported receiving an error message saying, \\"The component cannot be found,\\" even though the component was still connected. This essentially rendered the computer useless because you could no longer interact with that component, which is a significant problem!\\n\\n# What Else Is New?\\n\\nBesides the rollback of the RC bugfix, we\'ve implemented a few other updates and changes to improve your experience with ScrapComputers. Here\'s the full changelog:\\n- Removed RC Bugfix: We had to revert the fix for the RC bug due to its negative impact.\\n- Enhanced Keyboard Functionality in Seats: You can now use the keyboard while sitting in a seat, even though there\'s no icon indicating this feature when you\'re connected to the seat.\\n- Fixed Critical Computer Issue: Previously, the computer wasn\u2019t affected by our ban-system process. This has now been fixed.\\n\\n# What Does This Mean for You?\\n\\nWhile it might sound counterintuitive to reintroduce a bug, this step was necessary to maintain stability and usability. We\u2019re committed to providing you with a seamless experience in ScrapComputers, and sometimes that involves a bit of backtracking to move forward.\\n\\n# Fresh New Bug Discovery!\\n\\nDuring our testing and community feedback, we discovered a new bug. One of our community members, The Red Builder, encountered an issue while working on a project with ScrapComputers. When setting `self.cl` to an empty table in an unsafe environment, it caused significant problems. ScrapComputers uses self.cl for client-side variables, so when he did that, it effectively wiped out his entire computer setup, resulting in errors like `unable to find self.sv`, which is not typical behavior.\\n\\nWe are planning to fix this issue soon. In the meantime, we recommend avoiding setting `self.sv` or `self.cl` in the computer when in an unsafe environment."},{"id":"update-addon-system","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/update-addon-system","source":"@site/blog/2024-06-22-update-addon-system.md","title":"Update: The Addon System Update","description":"We just made our add-on system a LOT better than before!

After 1 issue we encountered, we have done it!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nBut first, let\'s dive around a couple of days ago. So, we had an issue where we couldn\'t manage to sync a variable across mods, but when **Ben Bingo** asked that issue in **The Guild of Scrap Mechanic Modders**. Then **June** gave us the solution! One came after the other. Now we have the best Addon System out of all other computer mods.\\n\\nWe also are the 1st ever computer mod to allow the Addon Developers to make configurations with just code! You can make configurations in just two lines, 1 for initializing the config functions and the other for creating them!\\n\\nAfter changing how the structure works in the mod and how things work, You can also modify the environment variables of the Computer API! You can also access the Computer API from Components via the Addon API!\\n\\nYou can also now take a masked frame for cameras via the `getMaskedFrame` function. It would be useful for such as detecting objects. What it does is via a mask parameter, Pixels become white if that raycast\'s result type is the mask (So if the mask is \\"body\\", all white pixels mean that it hit a \\"body\\"). It can also be an array in case you want to detect multiple things.\\n\\nWe also added 2 new modules. **The BitStream Module and the VPBS Module.** The BitStream Module is a Module to read/write to binary via bitstreams! The VPBS module makes converting from **lua tables to binary and vice-versa easier** via the **bitstream module.**\\n\\nThere are also more table functions added to your table\'s tables!\\n\\nWe also **improved the config updater** to be done for every config option. So you don\'t have to reset your configuration when making addons\\n\\nWe also fixed some bugs in the mod! One of the bugs has been solved, but not in the other computer mods.\\n\\nThanks to everyone who supported our mods, the people who gaved us suggestions and found bugs! We see you in the next update!"}]}}')}}]);
