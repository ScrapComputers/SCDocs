For people wondering if you can still network images, the answer is yes! All you have to do is send the camera over the network instead.\\r\\n- Heavy optimisation.\\r\\n- Improved image quality with focus on shadows, biome blending and color accuracy.\\r\\n- Added custom functions which allow you to draw frames or video with your own custom drawer.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Laser:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Added a visual laser that can be toggled on and off with toggleLaser.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Computer: \\r\\n\\r\\n- New backend system which includes optimisation.\\r\\n- Added always on feature.\\r\\n- Fixed bug with networking too much code.\\r\\n- Improved error messages.\\r\\n- Modified the examples due to function renames and system changes, also added new ones.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Speaker:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Function renames.\\r\\n- Removed queue system.\\r\\n- Bug fixes with parameters.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Hologram:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Bug fixed with setRotation changing the scale of the effect.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Radar:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Optimization.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, there is a lot more to see than listed here, we recommend you have a deep dive in the docs to see everything. Usually bugs come with a large update like this, so dont hesitate to get in contact to report a bug, and we will try our best to fix it in a timley manner.

That is not even a joke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nYou might be wondering, \\"Did we just undo a bugfix to solve a problem?\\" Yes, that\u2019s precisely what happened! In our latest update for ScrapComputers, we had to remove a previous bugfix and essentially reintroduce a bug to address an even more significant issue. Let\'s dive into the details.\\r\\n\\r\\n# The RC Bug: What\u2019s the Deal?\\r\\n\\r\\nFor those unfamiliar with the RC bug in ScrapComputers, it allows remote control of components even when they have no physical connections. Sounds neat, right? Well, not really. While this might seem like a handy feature, it led to unexpected behavior and caused more harm than good. The original fix aimed to tackle this issue but ended up causing more trouble. So, we had to roll back the fix to restore stability.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn example of the issues caused by the RC bug was that it could \\"brick\\" your computer. Users reported receiving an error message saying, \\"The component cannot be found,\\" even though the component was still connected. This essentially rendered the computer useless because you could no longer interact with that component, which is a significant problem!\\r\\n\\r\\n# What Else Is New?\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the rollback of the RC bugfix, we\'ve implemented a few other updates and changes to improve your experience with ScrapComputers. Here\'s the full changelog:\\r\\n- Removed RC Bugfix: We had to revert the fix for the RC bug due to its negative impact.\\r\\n- Enhanced Keyboard Functionality in Seats: You can now use the keyboard while sitting in a seat, even though there\'s no icon indicating this feature when you\'re connected to the seat.\\r\\n- Fixed Critical Computer Issue: Previously, the computer wasn\u2019t affected by our ban-system process. This has now been fixed.\\r\\n\\r\\n# What Does This Mean for You?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it might sound counterintuitive to reintroduce a bug, this step was necessary to maintain stability and usability. We\u2019re committed to providing you with a seamless experience in ScrapComputers, and sometimes that involves a bit of backtracking to move forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Fresh New Bug Discovery!\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring our testing and community feedback, we discovered a new bug. One of our community members, The Red Builder, encountered an issue while working on a project with ScrapComputers. When setting `self.cl` to an empty table in an unsafe environment, it caused significant problems. ScrapComputers uses self.cl for client-side variables, so when he did that, it effectively wiped out his entire computer setup, resulting in errors like `unable to find self.sv`, which is not typical behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are planning to fix this issue soon. In the meantime, we recommend avoiding setting `self.sv` or `self.cl` in the computer when in an unsafe environment."},{"id":"update-addon-system","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/update-addon-system","source":"@site/blog/2024-06-22-update-addon-system.md","title":"Update: The Addon System Update","description":"We just made our add-on system a LOT better than before!

After 1 issue we encountered, we have done it!\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nBut first, let\'s dive around a couple of days ago. So, we had an issue where we couldn\'t manage to sync a variable across mods, but when **Ben Bingo** asked that issue in **The Guild of Scrap Mechanic Modders**. Then **June** gave us the solution! One came after the other. Now we have the best Addon System out of all other computer mods.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also are the 1st ever computer mod to allow the Addon Developers to make configurations with just code! You can make configurations in just two lines, 1 for initializing the config functions and the other for creating them!\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter changing how the structure works in the mod and how things work, You can also modify the environment variables of the Computer API! You can also access the Computer API from Components via the Addon API!\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can also now take a masked frame for cameras via the `getMaskedFrame` function. It would be useful for such as detecting objects. What it does is via a mask parameter, Pixels become white if that raycast\'s result type is the mask (So if the mask is \\"body\\", all white pixels mean that it hit a \\"body\\"). It can also be an array in case you want to detect multiple things.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also added 2 new modules. **The BitStream Module and the VPBS Module.** The BitStream Module is a Module to read/write to binary via bitstreams! The VPBS module makes converting from **lua tables to binary and vice-versa easier** via the **bitstream module.**\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also more table functions added to your table\'s tables!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also **improved the config updater** to be done for every config option. So you don\'t have to reset your configuration when making addons\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also fixed some bugs in the mod! One of the bugs has been solved, but not in the other computer mods.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks to everyone who supported our mods, the people who gaved us suggestions and found bugs! We see you in the next update!"}]}}')}}]);
